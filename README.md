# Caesar Cipher (Python)

A simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** written in Python.

The project supports texxt encryption and decryption. It is intended for **educational purposes**, clean code practice, and as an exercise in basic cryptography and software design.

---

## Features

- Encrypt text using a configurable shift (1–25)
- Decrypt text using the same key
- Case-preserving substitution (A–Z, a–z)

---

## About the Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a classical substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

**Note:**  
This cipher is **not secure** and should not be used for real cryptographic purposes.  
It is included here purely for learning and demonstration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

No external dependencies are required.

---

## Usage

Run the program from the terminal:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
